[![NPM version][npm-image]][npm-url]

A yeoman generator to output a webpack boilerplate generator to seed internal MMT Digital projects. If you need to create a fresh front-end project for MMT, this is the tool to help you out!

## Installation
Assuming you have Node installed, installation is simple:

* `npm i -g yo generator-mmt-webpack`

Currently, Mac users will also need to install libpng (we're working on changing this):

* Install Homebrew
* `brew install libpng`

## Usage

**Note: Make sure the directory is empty. The generator will even create your package.json for you.**

To generate your MMT Digital front-end boilerplate, `cd` to the directory where the front-end code for your project is, then run:

* `yo mmt-webpack`

For more information on usage, please check on the internal MMT wiki (Drop a message in the #front-end Slack channel).

### Favicon Support

The webpack setup supports Favicon generation OOTB (Out of the box üëç).

In order to use this functionality; simply replace the image located at: `src/assets/images/favicon.png` with your project's required favicon. The task to generate the different icons, can be found in the base webpack config; should you wish to make an changes to the way icons are generated.
